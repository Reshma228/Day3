<p>​​​​The first movie is simply entitled Twilight. It introduces us to seventeen-year-old Bella (Stewart), who moves to Forks, Washington, to live with her father and the police chief, Charlie (Billy Burke). She is immediately drawn to Edward (Pattinson) when she starts at her new school. His hot and cold attitude intrigues and annoys her as she tries to figure out what he thinks of her. He soon reveals himself as a vampire, not a teenager like her but over 100 years old. That creates obvious conflicts, not least of which is that Bella's blood smells irresistible to Edward and his fellow vampires.</p>
